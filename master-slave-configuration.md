# Configure Jenkins Slaves on AWS EC2
Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems. As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.

### Prerequisites
1. EC2 Ubuntu 18.x Instance - _for Slave Node
   - With Internet Access
   - Security Group with Port `8080` open for internet
   - Java v1.8.x 

##Run Updates 
apt-get update -y

## Install Java
```sh
apt-get install java-1.8*
#apt-get -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk
```
## Setup Jenkins Slave
```sh
# Create user and add the user to wheel group
adduser jenkins-slave-01
# Create SSH Keys
sudo su - jenkins-slave-01
ssh-keygen 
# The private and public keys will be created at these locations `/home/jenkins-slave-01/.ssh/id_rsa` and `/home/jenkins-slave-01/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
cd .ssh
cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
chmod 700 authorized_keys

#create workspace
like > /home/jenkins-slave-01/
```

### Configuration on Master
Copy the slave node's public key[`id_rsa.pub`] to Master Node's `known_hosts` file
```sh
mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
cd /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
ssh-keyscan -H SLAVE-NODE-IP-OR-HOSTNAME >>/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
# ssh-keyscan -H 172.31.38.42 >>/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
chown jenkins:jenkins known_hosts
chmod 700 known_hosts
```

#### Configure the Slave using `Manage Jenkins`
Configure the node as shown here
`Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Nodes` > `New Node`
### Test Jenkins Jobs
1. Create “new item”
1. Enter an item name – `My-First-Project`
   - Chose `Freestyle` project
1. Under `General` Section
   - Choose `Restrict where this project can be run`
     - Update your _jenkins slave label_ `Java` 
1. Under Build section
   Execute shell
   ```sh
   echo "welcome to jenkins slave"
   ```
1. Save your job 
2. Build job
3. Check "console output"
